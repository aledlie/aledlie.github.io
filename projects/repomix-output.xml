***Fun Websites/Projects I've Made & That I'm Not *completely* embarrassed of:***
- [Website Analyzer at sitereader.io](https://sitereader.io/)
- [Sumedh's site, of course](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/).  Source code is at
  [my public github repo, Homage](https://github.com/aledlie/Homage).
- [This site's source code](https://github.com/aledlie/aledlie.github.io), which
  is by far the most front-end design work I've ever done - and by far the most work
  I've ever done on a side-project, ever.  Built on a different
  stack but with the same look and theme (minimal-mistakes) as the one Sumedh used to build
  his blog site back in 2014.  I even managed to use the same header images he did, which on
  its own took me literally days of AI-assisted attempts at discovering tooling to
  restore the images that had corrupted over 11 years.  Turns out, it's because
  they were actually, literally, un-recoverable - at least the ones I was using, which were from the last commit he made to his site - but I eventually found one, single commit he'd
  made in his history where the image files still had enough data to be recoverable.
- [This MCP Server That Visualizes Commit Data](https://github.com/aledlie/RepoViz)*Note: Probably the most fun to work on of all of these
- [Site Performance Test MCP Server](https://github.com/aledlie/PerformanceTest)
- [My actually organized dotfiles](https://github.com/aledlie/dotfiles)
- [This one was fun: easy bootstrap for new GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aledlie/automate.ts).  Written mostly to make my own, to auto-convert horrific-looking, confusing .css into pretty little descriptive Tailwind classes, without changing any aesthetics.  I *heavily* AI-assist all of my UX now, because I've always hated front-end.  Which is fine, but I like to actually know what it's doing, too.
- I have about 20 other half- or mostly-written projects, most of which are
  listed in the bottom part below; hopefully most of them will have moved up to
  the top half of this screen by the time Halloween rolls around.

***note: My still-todo-list on Sept. 7th, 2025 ***
- [] Write contributing guidelines (move fast, break things, plz don't break *everything*)

- [ ] Actually post the article listed directly above
- [ ] Read [this article](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) on NN performance, which was probably out of date the moment it was published.
- [ ] Work these two quotes somewhere into this website:
- [ ]“Selection bias is a hell of a drug.” ~F. Perry Wilson, MD, MSCE
- [ ]"The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity." ~C.A.R. Hoare (1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture)

- [ ] Create MCP out of all Integrity Studio's data and turns it into even more Todo-lists
- [ ] Self-host [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=devchallenge), probably on [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=devchallenge)
- [ ] Look into this use case for [BrightData](https://github.com/MeirKaD/MCP_ADK) as a quick-start
- [ ] Create some truly ridiculous stuff with my [MailSlurp](https://app.mailslurp.com/dashboard/) MCP server
- [ ] Another [data schema](https://ref.gs1.org/voc/) to play around with/make an MCP server out of
