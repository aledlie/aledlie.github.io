***Fun Websites/Projects I've Made & That I'm Not *completely* embarrassed of:***
- [Website Analyzer at sitereader.io](https://sitereader.io/)
- [Sumedh's site, of course](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/).  Source code is at
  [my public github repo, Homage](https://github.com/aledlie/Homage).
- [This site's source code](https://github.com/aledlie/aledlie.github.io), which
  is by far the most front-end design work I've ever done - and by far the most work
  I've ever done on a side-project, ever.  Built on a different
  stack but with the same look and theme (minimal-mistakes) as the one Sumedh used to build
  his blog site back in 2014.  I even managed to use the same header images he did, which on
  its own took me literally days of AI-assisted attempts at discovering tooling to
  restore the images that had corrupted over 11 years.  Turns out, it's because
  they were actually, literally, un-recoverable - at least the ones I was using, which were from the last commit he made to his site - but I eventually found one, single commit he'd
  made in his history where the image files still had enough data to be recoverable.
- [This MCP Server That Visualizes Commit Data](https://github.com/aledlie/RepoViz)*Note: Probably the most fun to work on of all of these
- [Site Performance Test MCP Server](https://github.com/aledlie/PerformanceTest)
- [My actually organized dotfiles](https://github.com/aledlie/dotfiles)
- [This one was fun: easy bootstrap for new GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aledlie/automate.ts).  Written mostly to make my own, to auto-convert horrific-looking, confusing .css into pretty little descriptive Tailwind classes, without changing any aesthetics.  I *heavily* AI-assist all of my UX now, because I've always hated front-end.  Which is fine, but I like to actually know what it's doing, too.
- I have about 20 other half- or mostly-written projects, most of which are
  listed in the bottom part below; hopefully most of them will have moved up to
  the top half of this screen by the time Halloween rolls around.
