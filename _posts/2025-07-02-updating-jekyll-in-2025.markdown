title: Updating a jekyll page after 8 years
---

Welcome to the personal website I built back in 2017.
I built it just to test out github pages and redcarpet over like an hour on a Sunday (both of which are still really cool).  aaand recently updated it on July 1st, 2025, when my dev environment was my macbook with an m2 chip.  I spent about 10 minutes updating content, and about 1-2 hours getting my ruby and macos to play nice together.  Major hattip [Moncef Belyamani](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/), whose instructions for debugging this manually were way more helpful than Grok, ChatGPT, and Cursor combined.  Most of the time was spent reinstallng xcode, which was *actually* a required step.
