excerpt:  "What is Alyshia Doing this week"
---

1) Writing out a technical roadmap, with milestones Integrity Studio needs to hit
in our tech stack to be able to really scale in January
2) Tricking one of my favorite people into working with us, who also happens to
be a brilliant data analyst and investigator.  I'm psyched.
3) Updating our data schematization MCP server to v2, and creating a new MCP for
webscraping (it's *really* cool)
4) Cheating by adding more things:
  - fixing a bug in the core Wix codebase that removed a data leak.  I
    benchmarked it, and just one fix plus a few other tiny ones:
      - Improved page loading times by ~75%
      - Used between 60-90% less data storage over time, depending on client size
      - Would save Wix ~$400/client/year if they implemented it
      - Dropped average site downtime from 4 times/year to zero
      - You can read more detail in the documentation I wrote for it [here](https://tinyurl.com/236cwczk).
  - rolled out v2 of our first MCP and let it loose to do some real websites to
    get some benchmark data.  I still need way more data to trust this, but preliminary results, just from
    integrating the MCP server with the WebScraping framework I built last year
    looks like it can:
    | Metric | Baseline | With Structured Data | Improvement |
    |--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
    | **SEO Score** | 35-45/100 | 70-85/100 | **+60-90%** |
    | **LLM Compatibility** | 25-35/100 | 75-90/100 | **+150-200%** |
    | **Rich Snippet Eligibility** | 5-15% | 70-85% | **+400-1000%** |
    | **AI Entity Recognition** | Poor | Excellent | **+300%** |
    Which for business impact roughly translates to:
      - **Organic Traffic**: 5-15% increase from improved SEO scores
      - **Click-Through Rate**: 10-30% improvement from rich snippets
      - **Voice Search**: 200-300% better AI assistant responses
      - **Brand Authority**: Enhanced credibility through structured data
   - Complete test suites and packages for both of these projects [here](https://github.com/aledlie/SingleSiteScraper) and [here](https://github.com/aledlie/RepoViz)
   - Tests & Integration with Fisterra's site [here](https://github.com/aledlie/fisterra), and will be doing this for Inspired Movement ASAP - I just couldn't get into the account tonight without sitting next to Favian (the owner) for his 2-fac
5) Messing up some of the aesthetics of my personal website, which I have decided not to care
about, because it's 7:30 a.m.
6) Recruited Darwin to help us - this is actually a pretty big deal, he will
call me on bullshit and keep me from making mistakes.  VERY valuable to me right
now.
7) Made my house 50% livable again.
8) I'm NOW GOING TO SLEEP.  I've loved this, but with everything else this week
I'm totally exhausted, and plan on taking tomorrow off and away from screens as much as possible.  I'll still be
around for questions, or praise (I created, like, 2 new sellable products *last
night*), but won't be proactively checking anything.

This is, at least, an improvement from the list of 20 things this was last week
:).
