Because apparently I don't write enough code at work, so I'm playing around with GitHub Pages on the weekend.  This post was written in vim with markdown/Jekyll's default markdown and raw text processing.

Look at me, I'm a code snippit:

{% highlight PHP %}
public static function helloWorld(): string {
  return sprintf("%s %s", "Hello", "World!");
}
#=> returns "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}
