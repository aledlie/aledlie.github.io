Very much a work in progress, started in 2017 and picked up again a few weeks ago.  Hopefully you pop by again for the jokes and absurdity, and, well, stay for the jokes and absurdity. I promise I won't include too [many articles like this one](https://tinyurl.com/2569tvbc).

But, to quote the great Neil Gaiman, all stories are lies, and all writers are liars.  And I am chock full of lies.  So take that promise for what it's worth, which is practically nothing, and I'll see you here next week with a cartoon and meme about why people spending so much time on RAG databases and fine-tuning is gilding a lily (and just silly), to explain why we should all be taking more creatine supplements, and argue, with absolutely no ground to stand on, with a nobel laureate about the end of the world.

Cheers, you brave souls who have somehow gotten to the end of this very short post.  And as always, I'll leave you and the rest of our bizarre, fabulous, disorienting universe with all of my love, delight, and delirium,  after finally crashing out and signing off on this at 8:15 a.m., a few dozen research articles into a handful of fields deep, and having nerd sniped 4 of my PhD friends into staying up with me to chatter about nonsense, and giggle, and feed off of each others' unbounded curiosity.

It's been a great night at The Parlor, and I hope it's been at yours, too.
