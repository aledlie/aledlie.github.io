Founder & CTO of InventoryAI and Integrity Studio (2024–Present):
- In February 2024, Alyshia Ledlie launched two startup ventures – InventoryAI and Integrity Studio – where she leads as
Founder and Chief Technology Officer.  These ventures focus on automation-driven solutions for retail, security, compliance, and non-profit sectors.  
- Under her leadership, both startups have secured multiple B2B clients, seed funding, and partnerships with HEB, Austin governments, and accelerator interest.
- Integrity Studio's partnerships with Austin area non-profits has reduced their partner acquistion costs and contributed to the local community.

### **Entrepreneur-in-Residence / Consultant – Concierge.io** *(2023–Present)*
Since February 2023, Ledlie has served in an Entrepreneur-in-Residence/independent consultant role for Concierge.io, a
luxury travel and services platform. In this capacity, she worked on multiple projects spanning real estate, HR risk identification, and travel data insights/marketing,
automating day-to-day operations for multiple clients within a year.

### **Meta (Facebook)** *(2015–2023)*
• Trust & Safety Engineering Leadership (2015–2023): Alyshia spent 8 years at Facebook/Meta in technical roles focused on Trust & Safety (i.e. maintaining platform integrity and
combating abuse):
• **Technical Principal, AI Development Engineering (Meta, 2021–2023)**:
As a senior engineering lead at Meta’s Integrity org in Austin, she built a static-analysis and code-generation platform for managing ML-driven integrity automation (content moderation rules, features, models). This unified UI allowed developers and operations teams to deploy and monitor model performance and costs.
She also co-led development of an “Integrity Orchestration Platform” that unified fragmented trust & safety systems, cutting enforcement launch times by over 60%. In addition, she mentored engineers and defined performance metrics aligned with business needs.
• **Technical Principal, Trust & Safety Engineering (Facebook, 2017–2021)**:
Led the architecture and development of scalable Trust & Safety infrastructure at Facebook. Notably, she oversaw the zero-error-tolerance political advertisement risk management system for the 2020 U.S. election. Her initiatives improved automation in content enforcement workflows by 44% and reduced compliance-related workloads by 90%.  She also delivered 30+ internal lectures and executive briefings to drive adoption of improved tools across the company.

• **Technical Operations Engineer, Trust & Safety (Facebook, 2015–2017)**:
In her earlier role, Ledlie focusedon automating abuse-prevention workflows. She collaborated with engineering, data science, and product teams to raise automation rates above 98% for low- and medium-risk workflows 10. She acted as a “gatekeeper of system integrity,” troubleshooting stability issues and implementing solutions to emerging abuse vectors 10. She also built large-scale monitoring and alert systems to detect fraud trends, identifying “hundreds of new avenues for abuse” on the platform.


### **Other Roles**
- Business Technology Consultant – *The Advisory Board Company* (2014–2015)  
• Prior to Facebook, Alyshia worked as a consultant at The Advisory Board Company (a healthcare research and consulting firm). She implemented monitoring tools (Splunk, Nagios, RabbitMQ, New Relic) to
automatically alert on website performance issues 12. She helped enforce data protection protocols and coordinated across development, support, and executive teams to ensure successful client
software implementations. This role honed her skills in client-facing technical leadership.
•
Technical Consultant (Engineering & Analytics) – *Access Sciences* (2014): In mid-2014, Ledlie had a short tenure at Access Sciences in Houston, TX. There she developed an internal communication
platform (inspired by Facebook’s interface) for the company’s dispersed consulting teams. Her solution was quickly adopted by 100% of the team within 2 months, improving knowledge-sharing among consultants.


> *Ledlie’s professional history as a purpose-driven leader displays a unique passion for observability, transparency, and creating responsible automation while optimizing scalablity and performance. This blend of technical and regulatory expertise now informs her work as a startup founder, where she aims to build “scalable, risk-mitigating automation” for clients .

##### p.s. Frankly, this gives me a bit of imposter syndrome.  And I actually cut data out of it.  I *vastly* prefered the results I got by hacking myself with a tool called [maigret](file:///Users/alyshialedlie/Downloads/report_aledlie.html), which was (a) hilarious (b) actualy managed to pull quite a bit about me with only my github username and about ~2 seconds of runtime, (c) along with a bunch of accurate information about me, also pulled in 26 Russian accounts that were, how shall we say, NSFW.  Oh, and most importantly (d) be safe out there; don't use maigret, or any other open source hacking tools, unless you know what you're doing and have a strong and multi-layered system of passkeys.
