## Semantic HTML Analysis

   - Use `<article>` elements instead of clickable link wrappers
   - Impact: Better accessibility and semantic clarity

3. **Form Label Associations**
   - Fix mismatched `for` attributes on form labels
   - Add `aria-required` attributes
   - Impact: Improved form accessibility

4. **Team Member Cards**
   - Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for team photos
   - Replace extra headings with `<p>` tags
   - Impact: Better semantic structure

5. **Statistics Markup**
   - Use `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` for key statistics
   - Impact: Screen reader accessibility
