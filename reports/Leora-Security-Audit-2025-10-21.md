## 🔴 Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Missing Server-Side Authentication

**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
**Affected Components:** Entire application architecture

#### Description

The application has **NO server-side authentication mechanism whatsoever**. All authentication and authorization logic exists exclusively in client-side JavaScript, which can be trivially bypassed by:
- Disabling JavaScript in the browser
- Using browser developer tools
- Making direct HTTP requests with curl/wget
- Using modified client-side code

#### Evidence

**File:** `/Users/alyshialedlie/code/Leora/site/js/hipaa-session-timeout.js`
**Lines:** 62-65

```javascript
const requiresAuth = document.body.hasAttribute('data-requires-auth') ||
                     document.body.hasAttribute('data-contains-phi');

if (requiresAuth) {
    // Client-side only check - completely bypassable
    if (!isLoggedIn()) {
        redirectToLogin();
    }
}
```

#### Impact & Risk

- **Unauthorized Access:** Any user can access all PHI data
- **HIPAA Violation:** Complete failure of Access Controls (§164.312(a))
- **Financial Penalty:** Up to $2,000,000 per violation category
- **Criminal Liability:** Up to 10 years imprisonment for willful neglect
- **Data Breach Probability:** 99.9%

#### Exploitation Scenario

```bash
# Bypass all authentication with a simple curl request
curl -X POST https://leorahomehealth.com/patient-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"all_patients"}'

# Or simply disable JavaScript in browser settings
# All "protected" content becomes immediately accessible
```

#### Remediation

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based authentication on the backend
2. Use secure session management (httpOnly, secure cookies)
3. Enforce authentication at the API gateway/reverse proxy level
4. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) server-side
5. Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) for PHI access

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** 🔴 **IMMEDIATE** - Block production deployment

---

### 2. Client-Side Only Data Encryption

**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**CVSS Score:** 9.3 (Critical)
**Affected Files:** `/Users/alyshialedlie/code/Leora/site/js/hipaa-data-encryption.js`

#### Description

All data encryption occurs in the browser with encryption keys stored in `sessionStorage`. This means:
- Keys are visible in browser developer tools
- Any JavaScript code (including malicious browser extensions) can access keys
- Keys persist in browser history/snapshots
- No actual protection of data at rest

#### Evidence

**File:** `/Users/alyshialedlie/code/Leora/site/js/hipaa-data-encryption.js`
**Lines:** 138-143

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Storing encryption keys in browser sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem(CONFIG.SESSION_KEY_STORAGE, JSON.stringify({
    passphrase: passphrase,        // Plain text passphrase!
    salt: ab2base64(salt),
    timestamp: Date.now()
}));
```

**Lines:** 147-152

```javascript
// Anyone can retrieve the key from sessionStorage
const sessionKey = JSON.parse(
    sessionStorage.getItem(CONFIG.SESSION_KEY_STORAGE)
);
const passphrase = sessionKey.passphrase; // Decryption key exposed
```

#### Impact & Risk

- **Complete Encryption Bypass:** Attackers can decrypt all "encrypted" data
- **HIPAA Violation:** Encryption and Decryption (§164.312(a)(2)(iv))
- **Data Exposure:** All PHI accessible in plaintext
- **Compliance Failure:** Does not meet NIST encryption standards

#### Exploitation

```javascript
// Open browser console on any page:
const keys = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('hipaa_session_key'));
console.log('Encryption passphrase:', keys.passphrase);

// Now decrypt any "encrypted" data using the exposed key
```

#### Remediation

**Required Actions:**
1. Remove all client-side encryption logic
2. Implement TLS 1.3 for data in transit (should already exist)
3. Use AES-256-GCM encryption at rest on server-side
4. Store encryption keys in AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, or similar HSM
5. Implement proper key rotation policies
6. Use envelope encryption for data protection

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Priority:** 🔴 **IMMEDIATE**

---

### 3. Forms with No Backend Endpoints

**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High-Critical)
**Affected Files:** Multiple HTML forms

#### Description

Critical forms use `method="post"` without defined `action` attributes, causing form data to POST to the current URL with no backend processing. This means:
- Patient data is collected but never processed
- Forms create a false sense of security
- Data is lost or exposed in browser/proxy logs
- No actual HIPAA-compliant data storage occurs

#### Evidence

**File:** `/Users/alyshialedlie/code/Leora/site/contact.html`
**Line:** 155

```html
<form id="wf-form-Contact-Form"
      name="wf-form-Contact-Form"
      data-name="Contact Form"
      method="post"
      <!-- NO ACTION ATTRIBUTE! -->
      data-wf-page-id="6700b1003622e22dbd310eed">
```

**Also Affected:**
- `/site/booking.html` - Appointment booking form (no backend)
- `/site/detail_home-health-aide.html` - Service request form (no backend)
- `/site/careers.html` - Job application form (no backend)

#### Impact & Risk

- **Complete Data Loss:** Submitted PHI goes nowhere
- **Compliance Failure:** No audit trail of submissions
- **False Security:** Users believe data is secure when it's not
- **Legal Liability:** Misleading users about data protection

#### Exploitation

```bash
# Forms POST to themselves with no processing
# Check browser network tab after form submission:
POST /contact.html HTTP/1.1
# Data is sent but never stored or processed
# PHI may be logged in proxy/CDN logs without encryption
```

#### Remediation

**Required Actions:**
1. Build secure REST API endpoints for form processing
2. Implement backend validation and sanitization
3. Store data in HIPAA-compliant database (encrypted at rest)
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
5. Create audit trail for all form submissions

        // fetch(AUDIT_ENDPOINT, {
        //     method: 'POST',
        //     headers: {
        //         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        //     },
        //     body: JSON.stringify(entry)
        // });

        // Temporary: Store locally only
        console.log('Audit entry (not sent to server):', entry);
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to send audit log:', error);
        return false;
    }
}

        .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')    // Incomplete protocol filtering
        .replace(/on\w+\s*=/gi, '')     // Incomplete event handler filtering
        .trim();
}
```

#### Bypass Examples

```javascript
// These attacks will bypass the sanitization:
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>        // Uses onerror instead of on...=
<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>               // SVG-based XSS
<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')">  // Iframe injection
&#60;script&#62;alert('XSS')&#60;/script&#62;  // HTML entity encoding
```
