## Critical Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Time to First Byte (TTFB) - 454ms
**Issue:** NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT (target: < 200ms)

**Solutions:**
- Optimize server-side processing and database queries
- Implement proper caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Optimize DNS resolution with faster DNS providers
- Consider server-side rendering optimization

#### 2. First Contentful Paint (FCP) - null
**Issue:** POOR measurement (target: < 1,800ms)

**Solutions:**
- Prioritize above-the-fold content loading
- Inline critical CSS and defer non-critical CSS
- Optimize web font loading with font-display: swap
- Minimize render-blocking resources
- Use resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - null
**Issue:** POOR measurement (target: < 0.1)

**Solutions:**
- Set explicit dimensions for images and videos
- Reserve space for dynamic content and ads
- Use font-display: swap for web fonts
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use transform animations instead of layout-changing properties

#### 4. Time to Interactive (TTI) - null
**Issue:** POOR measurement (target: < 3,800ms)

**Solutions:**
- Minimize main thread work with code splitting
- Remove unused JavaScript code
- Implement efficient event listeners
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Optimize third-party script loading

#### 5. Total Blocking Time (TBT) - null
**Issue:** POOR measurement (target: < 200ms)

**Solutions:**
- Break up long-running tasks into smaller chunks
- Use setTimeout or requestIdleCallback for non-critical work
- Optimize JavaScript execution and parsing
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Consider using a service worker for background processing

#### 6. Speed Index (SI) - null
**Issue:** POOR measurement (target: < 3,400ms)

**Solutions:**
- Optimize the critical rendering path
- Implement progressive image loading
- Use skeleton screens or loading placeholders
- Prioritize visible content loading
- Minimize layout shifts during loading

### LOW PRIORITY

#### 7. Load Testing Optimization
**Issue:** System performing well under current load

**Solutions:**
- Consider stress testing with higher load levels
- Implement monitoring and alerting for production
- Document current performance benchmarks
- Plan capacity for future growth
- Consider implementing auto-scaling policies
