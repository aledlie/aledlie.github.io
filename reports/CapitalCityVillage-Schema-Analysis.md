### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps & Opportunities

#### 1. Incomplete Organization Schema

The current Organization schema is minimal. For a nonprofit organization, this is a significant missed opportunity.

**Current Completeness:** 25%

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Capital City Village",
  "legalName": "Capital City Village",
  "url": "https://www.capitalcityvillage.org/",

  "foundingDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Austin",
    "addressRegion": "TX",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "email": "contact@capitalcityvillage.org",
  "telephone": "+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.facebook.com/HelpfulVillage",
    "https://twitter.com/...",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/..."
  ],
  "nonprofitStatus": "Nonprofit501c3"
}
```

#### 2. Missing Nonprofit-Specific Schema

As a 501(c)(3) organization, additional schema types are highly recommended:

**NGO Schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "NGO",
  "name": "Capital City Village",
  "alternateName": "CCV",
  "description": "Member of the Village-to-Village Network",
  "foundingLocation": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "addressLocality": "Austin",
      "addressRegion": "TX"
    }
  },
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Senior care",
    "Volunteer services",
    "Aging in place",
    "Community support"
  ],
  "memberOf": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Village-to-Village Network"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Missing Event Schema

The organization hosts events like "Keep Aging Weird" and participates in "Amplify Austin" - these should have Event schema:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Event",
  "name": "Keep Aging Weird",
  "description": "Annual fundraising event for Capital City Village",
  "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode",
  "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "addressLocality": "Austin",
      "addressRegion": "TX"
    }
  },
  "organizer": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Capital City Village",
    "url": "https://www.capitalcityvillage.org/"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Missing Service Schema

The organization provides specific services:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "Volunteer Senior Support Services",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Capital City Village"
  },
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Austin",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Texas"
    }
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
