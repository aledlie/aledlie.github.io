***note: skip a page down if you want the actual todo list from my last week of
August***
- [x] ~~Make a TODO list~~ (Finally accomplished something today!)
- [x] Actually figure out what all of my projects are, what domain manager
- [x] Document domain managers where they are stored
- [x] Write a proper README that doesn't just say "it works on my machine" for
  my 50 github repos {Honestly, writing tests and READMEs w/LLMs is their best,
  most precious feature}
- [ ] Add the projects that have been living on my local for btw 1-12 years, add
  them to github or bitbucket {Not even close to this one}
- [x] Document installation steps (beyond "here's a curl command")
- [ ] Explain why I chose this tech stack (spoiler: I didn't, my m2 chip chose for me)
- [x] Add usage examples make sense, to actual humans (I did, but at 4 a.m.,
  soooooo I probably need to re-write it later)
- [ ] Write contributing guidelines (move fast, break things, plz don't break *everything*)
- [x] Create a proper license file (currently using the "please don't sue me" license; need the MIT one like the rest of the cool kids)
- [x] Add badges to make it look professional (even though it's held together with strings and duct tape, just like [OpenAI/Cursor](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1321/commits/a6a5f5a18e775b548f7f401b51e62c4936907791))
- [x] Document the 47 environment variables needed to run projects scattered in various .yml,
  Gemfile, package.json, and [insert_pkg_name_here].config
- [x] Explain the mysterious `config.json.example.backup.old.final.FINAL.swp` file {I just deleted it}
- [x] Add screenshots (real ones)
- [x] Write changelog (v1.0: "it exists", v1.1: "it still exists", v2: "it's
  broken" v2.1 "fixed it" v2.2 "-> profit") (I also graphed it!)
- [ ] Fix that bug that happens only on Tuesdays during a full moon
- [x] Fix jekyll [build bug](https://vercel.com/aledlies-projects/aledlie/FPBXEKNx9KTEr2rvKMT5bWKcHXpZ?filter=errors) that appears to only happen in Vercel :/
- [x] Add tests (currently using the "if it compiles, ship it" methodology)
- [x] Nvm, I just remembered I'm OG FB, #testinprod

# TODO List, for real though

- [x] Write August 31st Homage post
- [x] Post August 31st Homage post

- [x ] Update [this post](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/programming/when-do-i-write-code/) with data from my own github profile
- [x ] Use [this post](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/golf/how-good-is-the-average-golfer/) and [this post](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/golf/how-many-of-me-would-it-take-to-shoot-par-in-a-scramble/) to explain why a neural network trained on your brain would be better than you are at golf, or knowing your own name.
- [ ] Actually post the article listed directly above
- [ ] Read [this article](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) on NN performance, which was probably out of date the moment it was published.
- [ ] Work these two quotes somewhere into this website:
  - “Selection bias is a hell of a drug.” ~F. Perry Wilson, MD, MSCE
  - The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. ~C.A.R. Hoare (1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture)
- [x] Contribute to the ML Commons [AI Risk & Reliability](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/ai-risk-reliability/ai-risk-reliability/) working group
- [x] Integrate BrightData into my SingleSiteScraper to scale it and prettyify it
- [x] Figure out if I want to use [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) {So far, I do not, although i have been using AWS & Amazon Q quite a bit)
- [x] Submit and find more silly competitions like [this](https://dev.to/devteam/join-the-real-time-ai-agents-challenge-powered-by-n8n-and-bright-data-5000-in-prizes-across-five-3nmb?bb=240503)

- [ ] Create MCP for my various important filesystems
- [ ] Self-host [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=devchallenge), probably on [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=devchallenge)
- [ ] Look into this use case for [BrightData](https://github.com/MeirKaD/MCP_ADK) as a quick-start
- [ ] Create some truly ridiculous stuff with my [MailSlurp](https://app.mailslurp.com/dashboard/) MCP server
- [ ] Download some [AmazonQ](https://www.promptz.dev/rules) rules to my local
- [x] Follow [this format] for integrating schema.org and json data
- [x] MCP server that auto-identifies appropriate schemas out of html code
- [ ] Read [OpenAI's MCP Server specs](https://blog.christianposta.com/semantics-matter-exposing-openapi-as-mcp-tools/) and make one with it
- [x] Load [this](https://medium.com/@aywengo/building-my-first-mcp-server-schema-registry-dd37b9c94ba1) as a best-practices README.md into core amazonq resources
- [ ] Parse [this](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/tree/master/src/schemas/json) very comprehensive list of json struct definitions
- [ ] Play around with [these](https://json-schema.org/tools?query=&sortBy=name&sortOrder=ascending&groupBy=toolingTypes&licenses=&languages=TypeScript%2CYAML&drafts=&toolingTypes=&environments=&showObsolete=false&supportsBowtie=false) typescript data tools
- [ ] Another [data schema](https://ref.gs1.org/voc/) to play around with/make an MCP server out of
- [ ] MCP server that scrapes all of my emails, docs, messages, regular websites, and creates yet more TODO lists and emails out of them - probably using Bright Data
- [x] FINISH COMPLIANCE RESEARCH AGENT
- [ ] FINISH Dance calendar scraper as example for calendar scrapers & importers in general
