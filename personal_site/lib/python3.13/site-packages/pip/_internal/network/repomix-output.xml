This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

#
# We use Accept-Encoding: identity here because requests defaults to
# accepting compressed responses. This breaks in a variety of ways
# depending on how the server is configured.
# - Some servers will notice that the file isn't a compressible file
#   and will leave the file alone and with an empty Content-Encoding
# - Some servers will notice that the file is already compressed and
#   will leave the file alone, adding a Content-Encoding: gzip header
# - Some servers won't notice anything at all and will take a file
#   that's already been compressed and compress it again, and set
#   the Content-Encoding: gzip header
# By setting this to request only the identity encoding we're hoping
# to eliminate the third case.  Hopefully there does not exist a server
# which when given a file will notice it is already compressed and that
# you're not asking for a compressed file and will then decompress it
# before sending because if that's the case I don't think it'll ever be
# possible to make this work.
