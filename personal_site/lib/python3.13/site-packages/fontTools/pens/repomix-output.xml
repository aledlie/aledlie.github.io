"""fontTools.pens.basePen.py -- Tools and base classes to build pen objects.

The Pen Protocol

A Pen is a kind of object that standardizes the way how to "draw" outlines:
it is a middle man between an outline and a drawing. In other words:
it is an abstraction for drawing outlines, making sure that outline objects
don't need to know the details about how and where they're being drawn, and
that drawings don't need to know the details of how outlines are stored.

The most basic pattern is this::

	outline.draw(pen)  # 'outline' draws itself onto 'pen'

Pens can be used to render outlines to the screen, but also to construct
new outlines. Eg. an outline object can be both a drawable object (it has a
draw() method) as well as a pen itself: you *build* an outline using pen
methods.

The AbstractPen class defines the Pen protocol. It implements almost
nothing (only no-op closePath() and endPath() methods), but is useful
for documentation purposes. Subclassing it basically tells the reader:
"this class implements the Pen protocol.". An examples of an AbstractPen
subclass is :py:class:`fontTools.pens.transformPen.TransformPen`.

The BasePen class is a base implementation useful for pens that actually
draw (for example a pen renders outlines using a native graphics engine).
BasePen contains a lot of base functionality, making it very easy to build
a pen that fully conforms to the pen protocol. Note that if you subclass
BasePen, you *don't* override moveTo(), lineTo(), etc., but _moveTo(),
_lineTo(), etc. See the BasePen doc string for details. Examples of
BasePen subclasses are fontTools.pens.boundsPen.BoundsPen and
fontTools.pens.cocoaPen.CocoaPen.

Coordinates are usually expressed as (x, y) tuples, but generally any
sequence of length 2 will do.

    Constructs ``FT_Outline`` from the paths, and renders it within a bitmap
    buffer.

    For ``array()`` and ``show()``, `numpy` and `matplotlib` must be installed.
    For ``image()``, `Pillow` is required. Each module is lazily loaded when the
    corresponding method is called.

    Args:
        glyphSet: a dictionary of drawable glyph objects keyed by name
            used to resolve component references in composite glyphs.

    Examples:
        If `numpy` and `matplotlib` is available, the following code will
        show the glyph image of `fi` in a new window::

            from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont

            pen.show(width=width, height=height, transform=Offset(0, -descender))

    This pen can be used to check if a glyph's contents (outlines plus
    components) have changed.

    Components are added as the original outline plus each composite's
    transformation.

    Example: You have some TrueType hinting code for a glyph which you want to
    compile. The hinting code specifies a hash value computed with HashPointPen
    that was valid for the glyph's outlines at the time the hinting code was
    written. Now you can calculate the hash for the glyph's current outlines to
    check if the outlines have changed, which would probably make the hinting
    code invalid.

    > glyph = ufo[name]
    > hash_pen = HashPointPen(glyph.width, ufo)
    > glyph.drawPoints(hash_pen)
    > ttdata = glyph.lib.get("public.truetype.instructions", None)
    > stored_hash = ttdata.get("id", None)  # The hash is stored in the "id" key
    > if stored_hash is None or stored_hash != hash_pen.hash:
    >    logger.error(f"Glyph hash mismatch, glyph '{name}' will have no instructions in font.")
    > else:
    >    # The hash values are identical, the outline has not changed.
    >    # Compile the hinting code ...
    >    pass

    If you want to compare a glyph from a source format which supports floating point
    coordinates and transformations against a glyph from a format which has restrictions
    on the precision of floats, e.g. UFO vs. TTF, you must use an appropriate rounding
    function to make the values comparable. For TTF fonts with composites, this
    construct can be used to make the transform values conform to F2Dot14:

    > ttf_hash_pen = HashPointPen(ttf_glyph_width, ttFont.getGlyphSet())
    > ttf_round_pen = RoundingPointPen(ttf_hash_pen, transformRoundFunc=partial(floatToFixedToFloat, precisionBits=14))
    > ufo_hash_pen = HashPointPen(ufo_glyph.width, ufo)
    > ttf_glyph.drawPoints(ttf_round_pen, ttFont["glyf"])
    > ufo_round_pen = RoundingPointPen(ufo_hash_pen, transformRoundFunc=partial(floatToFixedToFloat, precisionBits=14))
    > ufo_glyph.drawPoints(ufo_round_pen)
    > assert ttf_hash_pen.hash == ufo_hash_pen.hash

(if you're familiar with postscript anyway), the **PointPen**
is geared towards accessing all the data in the contours of
the glyph. A PointPen has a very simple interface, it just
steps through all the points in a call from glyph.drawPoints().
This allows the caller to provide more data for each point.

        ntos: a callable that takes a number and returns a string, to
            customize how numbers are formatted (default: str).

    :Example:

        Fonts have a coordinate system where Y grows up, whereas in SVG,
        Y grows down.  As such, rendering path data from this pen in
        SVG typically results in upside-down glyphs.  You can fix this
        by wrapping the data from this pen in an SVG group element with
        transform, or wrap this pen in a transform pen.  For example:
        .. code-block:: python

            spen = svgPathPen.SVGPathPen(glyphset)
            pen= TransformPen(spen , (1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0))

        An exception to this rule is done for values that are very close to +2.0

        these occur in real fonts). When almost +2.0 values occur (and all other

        maximum positive value that can still be encoded as an F2Dot14: i.e.
        1.99993896484375.

        If False, no check is done and all components are translated unmodified
