This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.

<file_summary>
This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
</usage_guidelines>

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

r"""
Building the required library in this example requires a source distribution
of NumPy or clone of the NumPy git repository since distributions.c is not
included in binary distributions.

On *nix, execute in numpy/random/src/distributions

export ${PYTHON_VERSION}=3.8 # Python version
export PYTHON_INCLUDE=#path to Python's include folder, usually \
    ${PYTHON_HOME}/include/python${PYTHON_VERSION}m
export NUMPY_INCLUDE=#path to numpy's include folder, usually \
    ${PYTHON_HOME}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/numpy/_core/include
gcc -shared -o libdistributions.so -fPIC distributions.c \
    -I${NUMPY_INCLUDE} -I${PYTHON_INCLUDE}
mv libdistributions.so ../../_examples/numba/

On Windows

rem PYTHON_HOME and PYTHON_VERSION are setup dependent, this is an example
set PYTHON_HOME=c:\Anaconda
set PYTHON_VERSION=38
cl.exe /LD .\distributions.c -DDLL_EXPORT \
    -I%PYTHON_HOME%\lib\site-packages\numpy\_core\include \
    -I%PYTHON_HOME%\include %PYTHON_HOME%\libs\python%PYTHON_VERSION%.lib
