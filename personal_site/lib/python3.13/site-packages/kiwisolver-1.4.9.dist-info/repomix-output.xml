Our Copyright Policy
--------------------
Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Nucleic repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

    :alt: Documentation Status

Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving
algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the
`seminal Cassowary paper <https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf>`_.
It is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has been designed
from the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x
faster than the original Cassowary solver with typical use cases gaining a 40x
improvement. Memory savings are consistently > 5x.

In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python bindings for
Python 3.7+.
