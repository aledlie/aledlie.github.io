# Capstone Project Proposal

## AI Arbitration Governance Framework: Analyzing Due Process and Transparency Requirements for Algorithmic Dispute Resolution

**Focus Area: Institutional Innovation in Law**

## Executive Summary

International arbitration is experiencing a paradigm shift. In November 2025, the AAA-ICDR launched the first AI-native arbitrator from a major institution, while the ICC, CIArb, SCC, and VIAC have all issued guidance on AI use in proceedings. This project will develop a comprehensive governance framework for AI in arbitration, analyzing due process requirements and proposing model rules that balance innovation with procedural fairness.

This institutional innovation focus leverages Isabel's LLM specialization in International Commercial Arbitration and positions her as an expert in how arbitral institutions are transforming through AI adoption.

---

## Problem Statement

The rapid adoption of AI in international arbitration has outpaced governance frameworks:

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2024 | SVAMC and SCC issue first AI guidelines |
| March 2025 | AAA-ICDR and CIArb release AI guidance |
| April 2025 | VIAC publishes AI note |
| November 2025 | AAA-ICDR launches AI-native arbitrator |
| 2026 | ICC Task Force expected to issue recommendations |

**Critical Questions Remain Unanswered:**

1. Do AI arbitrators satisfy due process requirements across jurisdictions?
2. What transparency obligations should apply to algorithmic decision-making?
3. How should parties disclose AI use in proceedings?
4. What standards ensure AI-assisted awards remain enforceable under the New York Convention?

**Business Need**: [Company Name] requires a comprehensive framework to advise clients on AI in arbitration, evaluate institutional AI offerings, and contribute to industry standards development.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Conduct comprehensive comparative analysis** of AI guidelines from 8+ arbitral institutions
2. **Develop due process assessment framework** for evaluating AI arbitrators and AI-assisted proceedings
3. **Create model disclosure protocols** for parties and arbitrators using AI tools
4. **Analyze enforceability implications** of AI-assisted awards under the New York Convention

### Secondary Objectives

5. **Assess "high-risk" AI classification** implications under EU AI Act for judicial/arbitral systems
6. **Propose harmonized standards** for AI governance in international arbitration
7. **Develop training materials** on AI arbitration for dispute resolution practitioners
