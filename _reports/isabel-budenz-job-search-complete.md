## Cover Letter: Anthropic Policy Team

**Isabel Budenz**
Fuchsstraße
+31 (0)630639949
isabelbudenz@hotmail.com

---

[Date]

Anthropic
Policy Team
[San Francisco / London]

Dear Anthropic Policy Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining Anthropic's Policy team. Your recent commitment to [signing the EU's General-Purpose AI Code of Practice](https://www.anthropic.com/news/eu-code-practice)—and your statement that the Code "advances the principles of transparency, safety and accountability" that Anthropic has long championed—reflects precisely why I want to work here. As an LLM candidate in International Commercial Arbitration with specialized training in the EU AI Act and hands-on AI implementation experience at Integrity Studio, I can contribute directly to Anthropic's EU regulatory engagement and broader international policy work.

**Why Anthropic**

Anthropic describes itself as "equal parts research lab, policy think-tank, and technology startup." That synthesis is rare and, I believe, necessary. The AI governance challenges we face cannot be solved by technologists working in isolation from policy experts, or by regulators without deep technical understanding. Anthropic's commitment to building those bridges—through proactive policy engagement, Constitutional AI research, and transparent safety practices—is why I want to contribute to your work rather than somewhere else.

Your [case for targeted regulation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-case-for-targeted-regulation) resonated with me. The argument that effective AI governance requires precision—focusing on genuine risks rather than broad prohibitions—aligns with my own view developed through studying the EU AI Act. The Act's risk-based approach is directionally right, but implementation will determine whether it enables responsible innovation or creates compliance burdens that disadvantage safety-focused developers like Anthropic. I want to help ensure the former.

**What I Bring**

*EU AI Act Expertise—At a Critical Moment*

Anthropic is among the 5-15 companies globally subject to the enhanced requirements for frontier AI models under the EU AI Act. With GPAI obligations now in effect (August 2025) and full enforcement approaching, you need team members who understand both the regulatory requirements and how to translate them into operational practices.

My coursework on the EU AI Act gave me deep familiarity with:
- The GPAI model provider obligations Anthropic must meet
- Technical documentation and transparency reporting requirements
- The AI Office's enforcement approach and emerging guidance
- How the Code of Practice Anthropic signed will be interpreted and implemented

Critically, I can conduct this work across languages. As a native German and Spanish speaker with C2 English and working French, I can engage directly with regulators, review member state implementation guidance, and monitor policy developments across the EU's major jurisdictions—without relying on translation.

*International Law Foundation*

My legal training provides frameworks for thinking about AI governance that complement technical perspectives:

- **LLM in International Commercial Arbitration** (Stockholm University): Cross-border dispute resolution, jurisdictional complexity, enforcement mechanisms
- **LLB in International and European Law** (University of Groningen): EU institutional dynamics, fundamental rights frameworks, regulatory harmonization
- **Legal Researcher, A for Arbitration** (2019-2025): Rigorous research methodology, synthesizing complex materials, presenting findings to diverse audiences

International law teaches you to navigate situations where multiple legal systems with different values must coexist—exactly the challenge facing AI governance as the EU, US, UK, and other jurisdictions develop divergent approaches.

*Practical AI Implementation Experience*

At Integrity Studio, I worked on AI implementation for mission-driven organizations. [CUSTOMIZE: Add specific details—e.g., "I helped nonprofit clients evaluate AI tools against their values and operational needs, developing governance frameworks that enabled adoption while managing risks." / "I contributed to AI strategy assessments, translating technical capabilities into actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders."]

This experience taught me that the gap between policy on paper and implementation in practice is where most challenges arise. I understand how organizations actually adopt AI—the concerns, the constraints, the tradeoffs—which informs how I think about what makes regulation effective rather than merely well-intentioned.

**How I Would Contribute**

I am interested in roles where I can support Anthropic's policy engagement, particularly:

*EU Regulatory Affairs*
- Supporting compliance with GPAI model obligations and the Code of Practice
- Monitoring regulatory developments across EU member states
- Contributing to Anthropic's engagement with the AI Office and national authorities
- Preparing technical documentation and transparency materials

*International Policy Analysis*
- Tracking regulatory developments across jurisdictions
- Analyzing policy proposals and their implications for Anthropic
- Contributing to position papers and policy submissions
- Supporting engagement with policymakers and multi-stakeholder initiatives

*Stakeholder Engagement*
- Supporting partnerships with think tanks, academic institutions, and civil society
- Contributing to Anthropic's thought leadership in AI governance
- Helping communicate Anthropic's approach to diverse audiences

I am based in Europe and would be well-positioned to support Anthropic's London office and EU-focused work, though I am open to other arrangements depending on team needs.

**Why Now**

The next two years will be formative for AI governance. The EU AI Act is moving from legislation to implementation. The US is navigating federal-state tensions over AI regulation. International coordination efforts are accelerating. Anthropic's voice in these conversations matters—not just for the company, but for whether AI governance develops in ways that enable rather than hinder safety-focused development.

I want to contribute to that work. My legal training, EU regulatory expertise, multilingual capabilities, and practical AI experience position me to add value to your team from day one.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Anthropic's policy mission.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**
LLM Candidate, International Commercial Arbitration
Stockholm University

Institute for Law & AI
Summer Research Fellowship Program

Dear Selection Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Summer Research Fellowship at the Institute for Law & AI. As an LLM candidate in International Commercial Arbitration at Stockholm University with hands-on experience deploying AI solutions at [Integrity Studio](https://integritystudio.ai/), I offer a distinctive combination of legal training and practical AI implementation experience that positions me to contribute meaningfully to the Institute's research mission.

**Why Law & AI**

My path to this intersection has been deliberate. After completing my LLB in International and European Law at the University of Groningen, I pursued specialized coursework on the EU AI Act—not as an academic exercise, but because I recognized that the legal frameworks being written today will shape how AI benefits society for decades. That conviction deepened through my work with Integrity Studio, where I witnessed firsthand how AI tools can be deployed responsibly to amplify the impact of mission-driven organizations.

The questions the Institute explores—how legal frameworks should evolve to govern AI, how AI can enhance access to justice, and how lawyers must adapt to an AI-augmented profession—are precisely the questions I want to help answer.

**What I Bring**

My experience bridges legal scholarship and AI implementation in ways that complement the Institute's research agenda:

*Legal Research Foundation*
As a legal researcher for A for Arbitration (2019-2025), I developed rigorous analytical skills examining cross-border disputes. This experience taught me to synthesize complex legal materials across jurisdictions—a skill directly transferable to comparative AI law research.

*Practical AI Experience*
At Integrity Studio, I [CUSTOMIZE: describe your specific role/contributions—e.g., "helped nonprofit organizations identify AI use cases that aligned with their missions while navigating ethical considerations" / "contributed to AI implementation strategies that balanced innovation with responsible deployment" / "advised on governance frameworks for AI adoption in mission-driven contexts"]. This experience gave me practical insight into how organizations actually adopt AI—the gap between regulatory requirements on paper and implementation realities that the Institute's research can help bridge.

*EU AI Act Expertise*
My coursework on the EU AI Act provided deep familiarity with the world's first comprehensive AI legal framework. With the Act's prohibited practices now in effect (February 2025) and full application approaching (August 2026), I understand both the regulatory requirements and the compliance challenges organizations face.

*Multilingual Research Capability*
As a native speaker of German and Spanish, with C2 English and working French, I can conduct primary source research across the EU's major legal systems. This capability is particularly valuable for comparative AI law research, where member state implementation of EU frameworks varies significantly.

**Research Interests**

I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of AI and international dispute resolution—an area where I can leverage my LLM specialization. Potential research directions include:

- **AI in International Arbitration**: Analyzing how arbitral institutions (AAA-ICDR, ICC, CIArb) are developing governance frameworks for AI use in proceedings, and whether current approaches adequately address due process concerns

- **Cross-Border AI Compliance**: Examining how organizations navigate conflicting AI regulatory requirements across jurisdictions, particularly the tension between EU AI Act mandates and US federal preemption efforts

- **AI Governance for Mission-Driven Organizations**: Drawing on my Integrity Studio experience to explore how nonprofits and public interest organizations can adopt AI responsibly while maintaining stakeholder trust

I am open to shaping my research focus based on the Institute's priorities and my supervisor's guidance.

**Why the Institute for Law & AI**

The Institute's positioning at the intersection of legal scholarship and practical AI policy makes it uniquely suited to the research I want to pursue. Unlike purely academic programs, the Institute engages with how AI law actually affects organizations and individuals. Unlike industry roles, it maintains the independence to ask critical questions about AI governance.

I am drawn to the Fellowship's structure—combining mentorship with the autonomy to develop original research—and to the opportunity to contribute to the Institute's mission of shaping AI law and policy.

**Conclusion**

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my legal training, AI implementation experience, and multilingual research capabilities to the Institute for Law & AI. I am confident that the Fellowship would be mutually beneficial: I would gain invaluable mentorship and research experience, while contributing a distinctive perspective grounded in both legal scholarship and practical AI deployment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**
LLM Candidate, International Commercial Arbitration
Stockholm University

Jus Mundi
Talent Acquisition Team
Paris, France

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the International Arbitration Internship at Jus Mundi. Your mission to "power global justice through artificial intelligence" speaks directly to my conviction that technology can make international dispute resolution more accessible, transparent, and effective. As an LLM candidate specializing in International Commercial Arbitration with hands-on AI experience at Integrity Studio, I offer precisely the combination you seek: someone who understands international arbitration through the lens of technology.

**Why Jus Mundi**

I have followed Jus Mundi's growth from a legal research tool into a comprehensive platform reshaping how practitioners engage with international arbitration. Your partnership with the Dubai International Arbitration Centre on AI-powered case management, your arbitrator intelligence platform, and your role in making arbitral jurisprudence accessible demonstrate that you are not simply digitizing existing processes—you are reimagining what international dispute resolution can be.

This is exactly the kind of work I want to contribute to. The international arbitration community has historically operated with information asymmetries that disadvantage smaller parties and practitioners outside major arbitration hubs. Jus Mundi's AI-powered tools are democratizing access to the insights that were once available only to elite firms. That mission resonates deeply with my own motivation for studying law.

**What I Bring**

*Deep Arbitration Foundation*

My academic and professional background is rooted in international arbitration:

- **LLM in International Commercial Arbitration** (Stockholm University, 2025-2026): Specialized study of arbitration procedure, enforcement, and institutional frameworks
- **LLB in International and European Law** (University of Groningen, 2022-2025): Foundation in cross-border legal analysis
- **Legal Researcher, A for Arbitration** (2019-2025): Extensive experience researching arbitration proceedings, analyzing awards, and synthesizing complex dispute materials

At A for Arbitration, I developed the research skills that would directly transfer to Jus Mundi's work: analyzing arbitral awards, identifying legal patterns across cases, and presenting findings in accessible formats. I understand the materials your platform organizes because I have spent years working with them.

*Practical AI Experience*

At Integrity Studio, I gained hands-on experience with AI implementation in mission-driven contexts. [CUSTOMIZE: Add specific details about your role—e.g., "I contributed to AI strategy development for nonprofit clients, helping organizations identify high-impact AI applications while navigating responsible deployment considerations."] This experience taught me how AI tools actually get adopted by organizations—the gap between technical capability and practical implementation that Jus Mundi bridges for the arbitration community.

*Multilingual Capability*

International arbitration is inherently multilingual, and so is your platform. As a native speaker of both German and Spanish, with C2 English and working French, I can:

- Conduct research across arbitration materials in multiple languages
- Understand nuances in awards and decisions that automated translation might miss
- Support Jus Mundi's coverage of arbitration in German-speaking (DIS, VIAC) and Spanish-speaking jurisdictions
- Contribute to quality assurance for multilingual content

This linguistic range is particularly valuable as Jus Mundi expands coverage of regional arbitration centers and civil law jurisdictions.

*Understanding of the AI-Arbitration Intersection*

My coursework on the EU AI Act and my research on AI in arbitration have given me insight into the regulatory and governance questions facing legal AI platforms:

- How AI tools should handle confidentiality in arbitration materials
- What transparency obligations apply to AI-assisted legal research
- How platforms can ensure AI outputs meet the accuracy standards practitioners require
- The emerging institutional guidance (CIArb, SCC, AAA-ICDR) on AI use in arbitration

I can contribute not just to Jus Mundi's current operations but to thinking through the governance challenges that will shape legal AI's future.

**What I Hope to Contribute**

I am drawn to Jus Mundi because you sit at the exact intersection of my expertise and interests. I would welcome the opportunity to:

- **Support arbitration research and content development**: Leveraging my A for Arbitration experience to analyze awards, identify trends, and ensure data quality
- **Contribute multilingual capabilities**: Expanding coverage of German and Spanish-language arbitration materials
- **Bridge legal and technical perspectives**: Helping translate between what arbitration practitioners need and what AI can deliver
- **Engage with product development**: Providing the practitioner perspective that makes Jus Mundi's tools genuinely useful

I am flexible on location and would be excited to join any of your offices—Paris, London, New York, or Singapore—depending on team needs.

**Why Now**

International arbitration is at an inflection point. The AAA-ICDR has launched an AI arbitrator. The ICC has established an AI Task Force. Institutions worldwide are developing AI governance frameworks. Jus Mundi is positioned at the center of this transformation, and I want to be part of building the tools that will define how arbitration evolves.

I would be honored to contribute to Jus Mundi's mission and to learn from a team that is genuinely pioneering the future of legal technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your work.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**
LLM Candidate, International Commercial Arbitration
Stockholm University
