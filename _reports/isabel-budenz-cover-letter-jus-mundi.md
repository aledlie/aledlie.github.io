Jus Mundi
Talent Acquisition Team
Paris, France

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the International Arbitration Internship at Jus Mundi. Your mission to "power global justice through artificial intelligence" speaks directly to my conviction that technology can make international dispute resolution more accessible, transparent, and effective. As an LLM candidate specializing in International Commercial Arbitration with hands-on AI experience at Integrity Studio, I offer precisely the combination you seek: someone who understands international arbitration through the lens of technology.

**Why Jus Mundi**

I have followed Jus Mundi's growth from a legal research tool into a comprehensive platform reshaping how practitioners engage with international arbitration. Your partnership with the Dubai International Arbitration Centre on AI-powered case management, your arbitrator intelligence platform, and your role in making arbitral jurisprudence accessible demonstrate that you are not simply digitizing existing processes—you are reimagining what international dispute resolution can be.

This is exactly the kind of work I want to contribute to. The international arbitration community has historically operated with information asymmetries that disadvantage smaller parties and practitioners outside major arbitration hubs. Jus Mundi's AI-powered tools are democratizing access to the insights that were once available only to elite firms. That mission resonates deeply with my own motivation for studying law.

**What I Bring**

*Deep Arbitration Foundation*

My academic and professional background is rooted in international arbitration:

- **LLM in International Commercial Arbitration** (Stockholm University, 2025-2026): Specialized study of arbitration procedure, enforcement, and institutional frameworks
- **LLB in International and European Law** (University of Groningen, 2022-2025): Foundation in cross-border legal analysis
- **Legal Researcher, A for Arbitration** (2019-2025): Extensive experience researching arbitration proceedings, analyzing awards, and synthesizing complex dispute materials

At A for Arbitration, I developed the research skills that would directly transfer to Jus Mundi's work: analyzing arbitral awards, identifying legal patterns across cases, and presenting findings in accessible formats. I understand the materials your platform organizes because I have spent years working with them.

*Practical AI Experience*

At Integrity Studio, I gained hands-on experience with AI implementation in mission-driven contexts. [CUSTOMIZE: Add specific details about your role—e.g., "I contributed to AI strategy development for nonprofit clients, helping organizations identify high-impact AI applications while navigating responsible deployment considerations."] This experience taught me how AI tools actually get adopted by organizations—the gap between technical capability and practical implementation that Jus Mundi bridges for the arbitration community.

*Multilingual Capability*

International arbitration is inherently multilingual, and so is your platform. As a native speaker of both German and Spanish, with C2 English and working French, I can:

- Conduct research across arbitration materials in multiple languages
- Understand nuances in awards and decisions that automated translation might miss
- Support Jus Mundi's coverage of arbitration in German-speaking (DIS, VIAC) and Spanish-speaking jurisdictions
- Contribute to quality assurance for multilingual content

This linguistic range is particularly valuable as Jus Mundi expands coverage of regional arbitration centers and civil law jurisdictions.

*Understanding of the AI-Arbitration Intersection*

My coursework on the EU AI Act and my research on AI in arbitration have given me insight into the regulatory and governance questions facing legal AI platforms:

- How AI tools should handle confidentiality in arbitration materials
- What transparency obligations apply to AI-assisted legal research
- How platforms can ensure AI outputs meet the accuracy standards practitioners require
- The emerging institutional guidance (CIArb, SCC, AAA-ICDR) on AI use in arbitration

I can contribute not just to Jus Mundi's current operations but to thinking through the governance challenges that will shape legal AI's future.

**What I Hope to Contribute**

I am drawn to Jus Mundi because you sit at the exact intersection of my expertise and interests. I would welcome the opportunity to:

- **Support arbitration research and content development**: Leveraging my A for Arbitration experience to analyze awards, identify trends, and ensure data quality
- **Contribute multilingual capabilities**: Expanding coverage of German and Spanish-language arbitration materials
- **Bridge legal and technical perspectives**: Helping translate between what arbitration practitioners need and what AI can deliver
- **Engage with product development**: Providing the practitioner perspective that makes Jus Mundi's tools genuinely useful

I am flexible on location and would be excited to join any of your offices—Paris, London, New York, or Singapore—depending on team needs.

**Why Now**

International arbitration is at an inflection point. The AAA-ICDR has launched an AI arbitrator. The ICC has established an AI Task Force. Institutions worldwide are developing AI governance frameworks. Jus Mundi is positioned at the center of this transformation, and I want to be part of building the tools that will define how arbitration evolves.

I would be honored to contribute to Jus Mundi's mission and to learn from a team that is genuinely pioneering the future of legal technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your work.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**
LLM Candidate, International Commercial Arbitration
Stockholm University
