## Test Suite Results

### Core Web Vitals: 32/100 üî¥

| Metric | Value | Status | Rating |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | 1006.76ms | ‚úÖ GOOD | Under 2.5s threshold |
| **FID** (First Input Delay) | null | ‚ùå POOR | Not measured |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | null | ‚ùå POOR | Not measured |
| **Execution Time** | 40s | | |

**Analysis:**
- LCP is within acceptable range (< 2.5s), indicating fast main content rendering
- FID and CLS metrics are not being captured, suggesting monitoring issues
- Missing metrics represent critical gaps in user experience measurement

---

### Beyond Core Web Vitals: 17/100 üî¥

| Metric | Value | Status | Rating |
