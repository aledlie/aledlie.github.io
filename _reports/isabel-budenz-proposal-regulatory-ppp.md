# Capstone Project Proposal

## Navigating the AI Regulatory Patchwork: A Multi-Stakeholder Governance Framework for Responsible AI

**Focus Area: AI Industry Regulation & Public-Private Partnerships**

## Executive Summary

The global AI regulatory landscape is fragmenting rapidly. The EU AI Act established the world's first comprehensive framework, while the US pursues a deregulatory federal approach that conflicts with state-level initiatives. Meanwhile, public-private partnerships like the Partnership on AI and standards bodies like NIST and ISO are developing soft law frameworks that increasingly influence compliance expectations.

This project will develop a practical governance framework for AI companies navigating this complex multi-jurisdictional environment, with particular focus on public-private partnership models that can bridge regulatory gaps and build the trust necessary for AI adoption.

This regulatory and governance focus leverages Isabel's International and European Law background and EU AI Act coursework, positioning her as an expert in cross-border AI compliance and multi-stakeholder governance.

## Problem Statement

### The Regulatory Fragmentation Challenge

**EU AI Act Timeline (Now in Effect)**

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| August 1, 2024 | Entered into force |
| February 2, 2025 | Prohibited AI practices banned; AI literacy requirements effective |
| August 2, 2025 | GPAI obligations; AI Office operational; national authorities designated |
| August 2, 2026 | Full application including high-risk AI systems |
| August 2, 2027 | Safety components compliance |

**Penalties**: Up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global annual turnover

**US Federal-State Tension**

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| January 2025 | Executive Order 14179 revoked Biden AI executive order |
| July 2025 | "Preventing Woke AI" order established federal procurement requirements |
| December 2025 | "National AI Policy Framework" order signaled federal preemption of state laws |

The December 2025 order:
- Established AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws
- Directed Commerce Department evaluation of state laws within 90 days
- Specifically targeted Colorado AI Act
- Ties federal funding to state AI policy compliance

However: 36 state AGs sent bipartisan letter opposing preemption; Senate voted 99-1 against penalizing states.

**The Trust Gap**

- AI enterprise adoption surged 115% (2023-2024)
- Only 62% of business leaders believe AI is deployed responsibly
- Only 39% of companies have adequate AI governance frameworks
- Estimated $4.8 trillion unrealized value by 2033 without trustworthy AI governance

**Business Need**: [Company Name] requires a comprehensive framework to navigate multi-jurisdictional compliance, engage effectively with regulators and standards bodies, and demonstrate responsible AI practices that build stakeholder trust.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Map the global AI regulatory landscape** across EU, US (federal + key states), UK, and international frameworks
2. **Analyze public-private partnership models** in AI governance and identify effective practices
3. **Develop a multi-stakeholder governance framework** for AI companies operating across jurisdictions
4. **Create practical compliance tools** mapping EU AI Act and state law requirements to operational practices

### Secondary Objectives

5. **Assess federal preemption risks** for state AI laws and develop contingency guidance
6. **Evaluate standards alignment opportunities** (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, EU AI Act)
7. **Propose engagement strategy** for standards bodies and multi-stakeholder initiatives
