# Capstone Project Proposal

## Responsible AI Integration in Legal Practice: Building Technical Competence in AI Tooling and Applications

**Focus Area: Technical AI Skills Development**

---

## Intern Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Isabel Budenz |
| **Program** | LLM International Commercial Arbitration, University of Stockholm (2025-2026) |
| **Background** | LLB International and European Law, University of Groningen (2022-2025) |
| **Languages** | German (Native), Spanish (Native), English (C2), French (B1) |
| **Relevant Experience** | Legal Researcher, A for Arbitration (2019-2025); Clifford Chance Antitrust Global Virtual Internship |
| **Relevant Coursework** | Introduction to AI and the EU AI Act; International Commercial Arbitration |

---

## Executive Summary

Legal professionals who can bridge the gap between law and technology are increasingly valuable. 79% of law firms have adopted AI tools, yet few lawyers have formal AI training. This project focuses on building Isabel's hands-on technical competence with AI tools while producing practical resources that help legal practitioners integrate AI responsibly.

Unlike the other project proposals that emphasize legal analysis, this project prioritizes **learning by doing**—working directly with AI tools, understanding their technical capabilities and limitations, and developing practical implementation guidance that meets ABA ethical standards.

This technical skills focus transforms Isabel from a legal professional who understands AI policy into one who can **implement, evaluate, and govern AI systems** in practice.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Legal AI Skills Gap

**Adoption vs. Competence**
- 79% of law firms have adopted AI tools (2024)
- Few lawyers have formal AI training
- 52% of law firm managers have shifted hiring criteria due to AI advances
- 66% of in-house legal managers seek different skills due to automation

**Ethical Framework Without Practical Guidance**

ABA Formal Opinion 512 (July 2024) requires lawyers to:
1. Understand AI capabilities and limitations (Rule 1.1 Competence)
2. Protect client information when using AI (Rule 1.6 Confidentiality)
3. Keep clients informed about AI use (Rule 1.4 Communication)
4. Verify AI-generated citations (Rules 3.1, 3.3 Candor)
5. Establish firm-wide AI policies (Rules 5.1, 5.3 Supervision)

**But**: Opinion 512 provides principles, not practical implementation guidance.

**State Requirements Accelerating**
- New York: 2 annual CLE credits in AI competency (Q3 2025)
- Pennsylvania: Mandatory AI disclosure in court submissions
- California: Multi-jurisdictional compliance for AI cloud tools

**Business Need**: [Company Name] needs team members who understand AI tools practically—not just legally—to evaluate products, advise clients, and implement responsible AI practices.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Develop hands-on proficiency** with 5+ legal AI tools across research, contract analysis, and drafting
2. **Create a comprehensive AI tool evaluation framework** aligned with ABA Opinion 512 requirements
3. **Build a prompt engineering playbook** for legal tasks with tested prompts and quality control protocols
4. **Develop firm-wide AI policy templates** and training curriculum

### Secondary Objectives (Skills Development)

5. **Earn AI-related certifications** (Clio Legal AI Fundamentals, Coursera Prompt Engineering)
6. **Understand technical AI concepts** (NLP, LLMs, hallucinations, bias) at practitioner level
7. **Build portfolio of technical artifacts** demonstrating cross-disciplinary competence
