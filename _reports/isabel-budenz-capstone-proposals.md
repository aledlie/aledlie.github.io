## Executive Summary

International arbitration is experiencing a paradigm shift. In November 2025, the AAA-ICDR launched the first AI-native arbitrator from a major institution, while the ICC, CIArb, SCC, and VIAC have all issued guidance on AI use in proceedings. This project will develop a comprehensive governance framework for AI in arbitration, analyzing due process requirements and proposing model rules that balance innovation with procedural fairness.

This institutional innovation focus leverages Isabel's LLM specialization in International Commercial Arbitration and positions her as an expert in how arbitral institutions are transforming through AI adoption.

---

## Problem Statement

The rapid adoption of AI in international arbitration has outpaced governance frameworks:

| April 2025 | VIAC publishes AI note |
| November 2025 | AAA-ICDR launches AI-native arbitrator |
| 2026 | ICC Task Force expected to issue recommendations |

**Critical Questions Remain Unanswered:**

1. Do AI arbitrators satisfy due process requirements across jurisdictions?
2. What transparency obligations should apply to algorithmic decision-making?
3. How should parties disclose AI use in proceedings?
4. What standards ensure AI-assisted awards remain enforceable under the New York Convention?

**Business Need**: [Company Name] requires a comprehensive framework to advise clients on AI in arbitration, evaluate institutional AI offerings, and contribute to industry standards development.

## A Multi-Stakeholder Governance Framework for Responsible AI

**Focus Area: AI Industry Regulation & Public-Private Partnerships**

---

## Intern Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Isabel Budenz |
| **Program** | LLM International Commercial Arbitration, University of Stockholm (2025-2026) |
| **Background** | LLB International and European Law, University of Groningen (2022-2025) |
| **Languages** | German (Native), Spanish (Native), English (C2), French (B1) |
| **Relevant Experience** | Legal Researcher, A for Arbitration (2019-2025); Clifford Chance Antitrust Global Virtual Internship |
| **Relevant Coursework** | Introduction to AI and the EU AI Act; International Commercial Arbitration |

---

## Executive Summary

The global AI regulatory landscape is fragmenting rapidly. The EU AI Act established the world's first comprehensive framework, while the US pursues a deregulatory federal approach that conflicts with state-level initiatives. Meanwhile, public-private partnerships like the Partnership on AI and standards bodies like NIST and ISO are developing soft law frameworks that increasingly influence compliance expectations.

This project will develop a practical governance framework for AI companies navigating this complex multi-jurisdictional environment, with particular focus on public-private partnership models that can bridge regulatory gaps and build the trust necessary for AI adoption.

This regulatory and governance focus leverages Isabel's International and European Law background and EU AI Act coursework, positioning her as an expert in cross-border AI compliance and multi-stakeholder governance.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Regulatory Fragmentation Challenge

**EU AI Act Timeline (Now in Effect)**

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| August 1, 2024 | Entered into force |
| February 2, 2025 | Prohibited AI practices banned; AI literacy requirements effective |
| August 2, 2025 | GPAI obligations; AI Office operational; national authorities designated |
| August 2, 2026 | Full application including high-risk AI systems |
| August 2, 2027 | Safety components compliance |

**Penalties**: Up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global annual turnover

**US Federal-State Tension**

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| January 2025 | Executive Order 14179 revoked Biden AI executive order |
| July 2025 | "Preventing Woke AI" order established federal procurement requirements |
| December 2025 | "National AI Policy Framework" order signaled federal preemption of state laws |

The December 2025 order:
- Established AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws
- Directed Commerce Department evaluation of state laws within 90 days
- Specifically targeted Colorado AI Act
- Ties federal funding to state AI policy compliance

However: 36 state AGs sent bipartisan letter opposing preemption; Senate voted 99-1 against penalizing states.

**The Trust Gap**

- AI enterprise adoption surged 115% (2023-2024)
- Only 62% of business leaders believe AI is deployed responsibly
- Only 39% of companies have adequate AI governance frameworks
- Estimated $4.8 trillion unrealized value by 2033 without trustworthy AI governance

**Business Need**: [Company Name] requires a comprehensive framework to navigate multi-jurisdictional compliance, engage effectively with regulators and standards bodies, and demonstrate responsible AI practices that build stakeholder trust.

---

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Map the global AI regulatory landscape** across EU, US (federal + key states), UK, and international frameworks
2. **Analyze public-private partnership models** in AI governance and identify effective practices
3. **Develop a multi-stakeholder governance framework** for AI companies operating across jurisdictions
4. **Create practical compliance tools** mapping EU AI Act and state law requirements to operational practices

### Secondary Objectives

5. **Assess federal preemption risks** for state AI laws and develop contingency guidance
6. **Evaluate standards alignment opportunities** (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, EU AI Act)
7. **Propose engagement strategy** for standards bodies and multi-stakeholder initiatives

## Executive Summary

Legal professionals who can bridge the gap between law and technology are increasingly valuable. 79% of law firms have adopted AI tools, yet few lawyers have formal AI training. This project focuses on building Isabel's hands-on technical competence with AI tools while producing practical resources that help legal practitioners integrate AI responsibly.

Unlike the other project proposals that emphasize legal analysis, this project prioritizes **learning by doing**—working directly with AI tools, understanding their technical capabilities and limitations, and developing practical implementation guidance that meets ABA ethical standards.

This technical skills focus transforms Isabel from a legal professional who understands AI policy into one who can **implement, evaluate, and govern AI systems** in practice.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Legal AI Skills Gap

**Adoption vs. Competence**
- 79% of law firms have adopted AI tools (2024)
- Few lawyers have formal AI training
- 52% of law firm managers have shifted hiring criteria due to AI advances
- 66% of in-house legal managers seek different skills due to automation

**Ethical Framework Without Practical Guidance**

ABA Formal Opinion 512 (July 2024) requires lawyers to:
1. Understand AI capabilities and limitations (Rule 1.1 Competence)
2. Protect client information when using AI (Rule 1.6 Confidentiality)
3. Keep clients informed about AI use (Rule 1.4 Communication)
4. Verify AI-generated citations (Rules 3.1, 3.3 Candor)
5. Establish firm-wide AI policies (Rules 5.1, 5.3 Supervision)

**But**: Opinion 512 provides principles, not practical implementation guidance.

**State Requirements Accelerating**
- New York: 2 annual CLE credits in AI competency (Q3 2025)
- Pennsylvania: Mandatory AI disclosure in court submissions
- California: Multi-jurisdictional compliance for AI cloud tools

**Business Need**: [Company Name] needs team members who understand AI tools practically—not just legally—to evaluate products, advise clients, and implement responsible AI practices.

---

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Develop hands-on proficiency** with 5+ legal AI tools across research, contract analysis, and drafting
2. **Create a comprehensive AI tool evaluation framework** aligned with ABA Opinion 512 requirements
3. **Build a prompt engineering playbook** for legal tasks with tested prompts and quality control protocols
4. **Develop firm-wide AI policy templates** and training curriculum

### Secondary Objectives (Skills Development)

5. **Earn AI-related certifications** (Clio Legal AI Fundamentals, Coursera Prompt Engineering)
6. **Understand technical AI concepts** (NLP, LLMs, hallucinations, bias) at practitioner level
7. **Build portfolio of technical artifacts** demonstrating cross-disciplinary competence

---
