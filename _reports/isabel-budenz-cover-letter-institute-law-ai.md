Institute for Law & AI
Summer Research Fellowship Program

Dear Selection Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Summer Research Fellowship at the Institute for Law & AI. As an LLM candidate in International Commercial Arbitration at Stockholm University with hands-on experience deploying AI solutions at [Integrity Studio](https://integritystudio.ai/), I offer a distinctive combination of legal training and practical AI implementation experience that positions me to contribute meaningfully to the Institute's research mission.

**Why Law & AI**

My path to this intersection has been deliberate. After completing my LLB in International and European Law at the University of Groningen, I pursued specialized coursework on the EU AI Act—not as an academic exercise, but because I recognized that the legal frameworks being written today will shape how AI benefits society for decades. That conviction deepened through my work with Integrity Studio, where I witnessed firsthand how AI tools can be deployed responsibly to amplify the impact of mission-driven organizations.

The questions the Institute explores—how legal frameworks should evolve to govern AI, how AI can enhance access to justice, and how lawyers must adapt to an AI-augmented profession—are precisely the questions I want to help answer.

**What I Bring**

My experience bridges legal scholarship and AI implementation in ways that complement the Institute's research agenda:

*Legal Research Foundation*
As a legal researcher for A for Arbitration (2019-2025), I developed rigorous analytical skills examining cross-border disputes. This experience taught me to synthesize complex legal materials across jurisdictions—a skill directly transferable to comparative AI law research.

*Practical AI Experience*
At Integrity Studio, I [CUSTOMIZE: describe your specific role/contributions—e.g., "helped nonprofit organizations identify AI use cases that aligned with their missions while navigating ethical considerations" / "contributed to AI implementation strategies that balanced innovation with responsible deployment" / "advised on governance frameworks for AI adoption in mission-driven contexts"]. This experience gave me practical insight into how organizations actually adopt AI—the gap between regulatory requirements on paper and implementation realities that the Institute's research can help bridge.

*EU AI Act Expertise*
My coursework on the EU AI Act provided deep familiarity with the world's first comprehensive AI legal framework. With the Act's prohibited practices now in effect (February 2025) and full application approaching (August 2026), I understand both the regulatory requirements and the compliance challenges organizations face.

*Multilingual Research Capability*
As a native speaker of German and Spanish, with C2 English and working French, I can conduct primary source research across the EU's major legal systems. This capability is particularly valuable for comparative AI law research, where member state implementation of EU frameworks varies significantly.

**Research Interests**

I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of AI and international dispute resolution—an area where I can leverage my LLM specialization. Potential research directions include:

- **AI in International Arbitration**: Analyzing how arbitral institutions (AAA-ICDR, ICC, CIArb) are developing governance frameworks for AI use in proceedings, and whether current approaches adequately address due process concerns

- **Cross-Border AI Compliance**: Examining how organizations navigate conflicting AI regulatory requirements across jurisdictions, particularly the tension between EU AI Act mandates and US federal preemption efforts

- **AI Governance for Mission-Driven Organizations**: Drawing on my Integrity Studio experience to explore how nonprofits and public interest organizations can adopt AI responsibly while maintaining stakeholder trust

I am open to shaping my research focus based on the Institute's priorities and my supervisor's guidance.

**Why the Institute for Law & AI**

The Institute's positioning at the intersection of legal scholarship and practical AI policy makes it uniquely suited to the research I want to pursue. Unlike purely academic programs, the Institute engages with how AI law actually affects organizations and individuals. Unlike industry roles, it maintains the independence to ask critical questions about AI governance.

I am drawn to the Fellowship's structure—combining mentorship with the autonomy to develop original research—and to the opportunity to contribute to the Institute's mission of shaping AI law and policy.

**Conclusion**

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my legal training, AI implementation experience, and multilingual research capabilities to the Institute for Law & AI. I am confident that the Fellowship would be mutually beneficial: I would gain invaluable mentorship and research experience, while contributing a distinctive perspective grounded in both legal scholarship and practical AI deployment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**
LLM Candidate, International Commercial Arbitration
Stockholm University

# Customization Notes

## Integrity Studio Section - Please Specify:

Replace the bracketed placeholder with specific details about your work. Examples:

**If you worked on AI strategy/consulting:**
> "At Integrity Studio, I contributed to AI implementation assessments for nonprofit clients, helping organizations evaluate how AI tools could advance their missions while identifying potential risks and governance requirements. This included [specific project/deliverable]."

**If you worked on research/policy:**
> "At Integrity Studio, I researched AI applications for the nonprofit sector and contributed to guidance documents helping organizations navigate responsible AI adoption. I specifically worked on [topic area]."

**If you worked on client-facing work:**
> "At Integrity Studio, I supported nonprofit clients in understanding how AI could enhance their operations, conducting needs assessments and translating technical capabilities into accessible recommendations."

## Research Interest Alternatives

Depending on your interests, you might emphasize:

**Option A: Focus on arbitration/disputes**
> "I am particularly interested in exploring how AI is transforming international dispute resolution—from AI-assisted document review to the emergence of AI arbitrators. My research would examine whether current governance frameworks adequately address due process, transparency, and enforceability concerns."

**Option B: Focus on nonprofit/mission-driven AI**
> "Drawing on my Integrity Studio experience, I am interested in researching how mission-driven organizations can adopt AI responsibly. This includes examining governance frameworks, transparency requirements, and accountability mechanisms suited to nonprofit contexts."

**Option C: Focus on EU-US regulatory divergence**
> "I am particularly interested in the growing divergence between EU and US approaches to AI regulation. My multilingual capabilities would enable comparative research examining how this regulatory fragmentation affects organizations operating across jurisdictions."

## Writing Sample Suggestions

Consider submitting:
- A paper from your EU AI Act coursework
- A legal memo from your A for Arbitration work (if shareable)
- A policy analysis you've written
