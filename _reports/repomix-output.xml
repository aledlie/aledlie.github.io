- Limited search engine understanding

**Key Issues:**
1. **No Organization Schema:** Search engines can't identify basic business information
2. **No LocalBusiness Schema:** Missing location-based search opportunities
3. **No WebSite Schema:** No site search integration in SERPs
4. **No Breadcrumb Schema:** Limited navigation understanding

**Recommended Schema Types:**
- Organization
- LocalBusiness (if applicable)
