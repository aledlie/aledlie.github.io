I've done a lot of writing - during my brief stint in academia and then during 14 years or so of corporate work - but this blog isn't for that.  It's really just supposed to be for me - the journal articles I particularly like, or a way to nail down how I'm thinking about something abstract.  Here, you will find the person my friends know, what it's like to ramble with me until way after you were supposed to go bed. I started it in 2017 and picked it up again a few weeks ago, orignially meant to be a one-shot homage to Sumedh Joshi, and the blog he used to write.

But I'm going to try to keep posting to it.  If you enjoy it, hopefully you pop by again for the jokes and absurdity, and, well, stay for the jokes and absurdity. I promise I won’t include too many articles like this one.

But, to quote the great Neil Gaiman, all stories are lies, and all writers are liars. And I am chock full of lies. So take that promise for what it’s worth, which is practically nothing, and I’ll either never post here again, or see you here next week with a cartoon and meme about why people spending so much time on RAG databases and fine-tuning is gilding a lily (and just silly), to explain why we should all be taking more creatine supplements, and argue, with absolutely no ground to stand on, with a nobel laureate about the end of the world.

Cheers, you brave souls who have somehow gotten to the end of this very short post. And as always, I’ll leave you and the rest of our bizarre, fabulous, disorienting universe with all of my love, delight, and delirium, after finally crashing out and signing off on this at 8:15 a.m., a few dozen research articles into a handful of fields deep, and having nerd sniped 4 of my PhD friends into staying up with me to chatter about nonsense, and giggle, and feed off of each others’ unbounded curiosity.

It’s been a great night here at The Parlor, and I hope it’s been at yours, too.
