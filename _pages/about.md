About Alyshia Ledlie
---
I'm intellectually promiscuous, a serious nerd, and an unrelenting optimist.  Ex-JD/PhD Securities Market Historian, Ex-Meta Staff Software Engineer, and currently helping companies and NGOs I believe in scale lightning fast with friends who are ==way, way== cooler and more brilliant than I am.  Nueral networks are helping a little.  I guess.
