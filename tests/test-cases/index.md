**To run analytics tests:**
```bash
npm run test  # Analytics tests are part of unit tests
```

**What gets validated**:
- GTM script loading with correct ID
- Google site verification meta tag
- Event tracking functionality
- Privacy compliance (Do Not Track, opt-out)
- Error handling for blocked/failed analytics

---

### ⚡ Performance Tests (Lighthouse)
**Purpose**: Measure Core Web Vitals and site performance
**When to run**: Before deployment or after major changes
**Test Time**: ~3-5 minutes

**To run performance tests:**
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Performance Score**: ≥90 (page load speed)
- **Accessibility Score**: ≥95 (WCAG compliance)

- **FID** (First Input Delay): <100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): <0.1
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): <2s
- **TTI** (Time to Interactive): <5s

---

### 🎨 Visual Regression Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure pixel-perfect visual consistency during refactoring
**When to run**: Before every commit during refactoring
**Test Time**: ~2-3 minutes

**To run visual regression tests:**
```bash
npm run test:visual
```

**How it works**:
1. Capture baseline screenshots before refactoring
2. Take new screenshots after changes
3. Pixel-by-pixel comparison (0.1% tolerance)
4. Generate diff images highlighting changes

**Pages Tested** (15 total screenshots):
- Homepage (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- About (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Posts Listing (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Post Detail (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Projects (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)

**⚠️ Zero-tolerance policy**: During refactoring, ANY visual difference is considered a bug.

---

### 📈 Baseline Performance Tests
**Purpose**: Statistical validation of build performance
**When to run**: At the end of each refactoring phase
**Test Time**: ~10-15 minutes

**To compare against baseline:**
```bash
npm run test:compare-baseline
```

**To capture a new baseline:**
```bash
npm run test:capture-baseline
```

**What gets measured**:
- Clean build time
- Incremental build time
- CSS file size
- SCSS line count reduction
- SCSS file count reduction

**Validation Method**:
- 5-10 test runs for each metric
- Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation)
- 95% confidence intervals
- Significance testing

---

## Testing Philosophy

This site uses a **zero-regression approach** to refactoring: every change must maintain or improve quality metrics. Statistical validation ensures changes are genuine improvements, not random fluctuations.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Control Groups**: Keep old code until verified
2. **Measurement Baselines**: Track all metrics systematically
3. **Statistical Validation**: Multiple runs, 95% confidence
4. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic tests, version-controlled baselines

**Simple Workflow**:
1. Run tests (baseline) → 2. Make change → 3. Run tests (should still pass) → 4. If fail: revert and fix → 5. If pass: commit

**When to Run Which Tests**:

| Scenario | Test Suite | Time | Frequency |
|----------|------------|------|-----------|
| After SCSS change | `test:smoke` | 1-2 min | Every change |
| Significant change | `test:critical` | 2-3 min | Before each commit |
| Before committing | `test:all` | 5-10 min | Every commit |
| End of phase | `test:compare-baseline` | 10-15 min | Phase completion |

**Learn More**: See [Testing Strategy (66 pages)](/documentation/refactoring/testing-strategy-2025-11-11.md) for comprehensive methodology and examples.

---

## Rollback Procedures

**Every refactoring phase must be reversible in <5 minutes.** Choose the appropriate rollback method based on severity:

### Phase Rollback (<5 minutes) - Recommended
**When to use**: Rollback a specific refactoring phase while keeping other work

**To rollback a specific phase:**
```bash
bash rollback-phase-N.sh
```

**Then verify everything works:**
```bash
npm run test:all
```

---

### Git Rollback - For Specific Commits
**When to use**: Undo specific commits or changes

**To revert a specific commit:**
```bash
git revert [commit-hash]
```

**To hard reset to master (⚠️ Warning: loses uncommitted work):**
```bash
git reset --hard origin/master
```

---

### 🚨 Emergency Rollback (<3 minutes) - Nuclear Option
**When to use**: Site is broken in production and you need immediate recovery

**⚠️ WARNING**: This reverts ALL changes. Use only in emergencies.

**To execute emergency rollback:**
```bash
bash emergency-rollback.sh
```

**Then verify site is functional:**
```bash
npm run test:smoke
```
